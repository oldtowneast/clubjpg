Photography Club Webring (webri.ng)

How can I be a member of this webring?

Your website must:

Use weblog.lol to host content. (You may use third-party tools to publish and manage your content.)
Display the webring links in a prominent and intuitive location at all times. (Ideally, they should be in the sidebar or the footer of the front page or landing page of your website; you may also place them on a dedicated page, but if you do so, kindly include the URL of the page in your application.)

I reserve the right to remove any websites that violate these rules from our directory.

First, please place the below links on the chosen location on your website:

<a href="https://webri.ng/webring/webloglol">The Unofficial weblog.lol Webring</a>

<a href="https://webri.ng/webring/webloglol/random?via=YOUR_WEBSITE_URL">Random Site</a>
Please replace YOUR_WEBSITE_URL with, well, your website's URL.

Optionally, you may add the below links:

<a href="https://webri.ng/webring/webloglol/previous?via=YOUR_WEBSITE_URL">Previous Site</a>

<a href="https://webri.ng/webring/webloglol/next?via=YOUR_WEBSITE_URL">Next Site</a>
Second, please send a plain-text email to ~darylsun/unofficial-weblog-webring@todo.sr.ht (yes, this is a working email address) with the subject line Request to Join the Unofficial weblog.lol Webring, and the below template in the body:

If the webring links are not on a dedicated page on your website, please write N/A.
